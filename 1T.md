## Distributed Systems and Network Concepets Review

### What's a distributed system?

> A distributed system is a collection of independent process which are spacially separated and communicate with each other by message passing.

#### What is a message?

> A message is a sequence of bytes, structured in a way that is meaningful to the application that sends it and to the application that receives it. Its format is specified by the application.

### Internet Protocols

> On the Internet, the properties of the communication channe provided to an application depend on the trasnport protocol used (UDP or TCP)
>> The design of a distributed system is influenced by the properties of the communication channels provided by the chosen transport protocol.

- Application Layer --> Specific communication services
- Transport Layer --> Communication between 2 or more processes
- Network Layer --> Communication between 2 computers not directly connected
- Interface Layer --> Communication between 2 computers directly connected
